# hello-world
This repository contains the files used for the Github tutorial.
Who am I?: I am a junior (as of 2023) at UCSC majoring in Computer Engineering with a concentration on Systems Programming. I like to play soccer, listen to music, and I love learning about computers (such as computer architecture, programming languages, etc.) and technology in general.
